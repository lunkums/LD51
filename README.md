## About

SHOTGUN DERBY is an arena shooter where you mow down zombies with a shotgun and lob grenades to explode them to bits.  Every 10 seconds, a new wave of zombies spawns as the horde grows progressively larger. I didn’t have enough time to make coins useful or to add a dynamic arena, but I was able to spend a lot of time polishing the core gameplay.

The game was made in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 51 game jam using MonoGame. I hope you enjoy it!
